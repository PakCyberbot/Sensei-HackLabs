This setup helps you quickly create environments for your pentesting-related CTFs. It handles all the necessary tasks to enhance the efficiency and save time during your pentesting activities.

Once installed, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to your CTF folder in the home directory.
2. Run the "setupCTFenv.sh" script.
3. This script will prompt you for the target IP and CTF box name. It saves the target IP as $TARGET and creates a folder in the CTF directory named after your CTF box/room.
4. Next, it opens two Terminator windows, each with multiple terminals:
   - The first window automatically starts a simple nmap scan and gobuster on your target. It reserves two terminals for additional enumeration. This window is for Enumeration and Vulnerability research.
   - The second window is for exploitation and post-exploitation tasks. It hosts a Python HTTP server to serve the /opt/transfers folder. This facilitates easy transfer of necessary binaries for the post-exploitation process on your target machine.
5. Afterward, the "setupCTFenv.sh" script launches the "marktext" binary. This allows you to take live-preview-enabled Markdown notes during your CTF sessions.

Feel free to adapt this setup to your specific needs and preferences.
